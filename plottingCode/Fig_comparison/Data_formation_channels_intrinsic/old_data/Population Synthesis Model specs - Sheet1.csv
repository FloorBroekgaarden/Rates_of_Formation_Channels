Special ,"pass implements a unique method in evolving binary systems to reduce computational time. Before the first supernova, the primary star is evolved in detail using the adapted STARS code (Eggleton 1971), while the secondary star is evolved using the single star rapid evolution equations from Hurley et al.

After the fate of the primary star has been determined and a natal kick has been applied, a secondary model is selected and the secondary star is evolved in detail, either as a single star or as a binary with a compact object, contingent on the outcome of the primary",,"pass implements a unique method in evolving binary systems to reduce computational time.
